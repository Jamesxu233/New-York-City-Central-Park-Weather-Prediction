For our concluding project, we have used the modeling methods to predict future temperatures. We have based our analysis on the GHCND dataset, obtained from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's website. This dataset offers extensive daily weather data, which has been crucial in fine-tuning and adjusting our models to improve their forecasting precision.

To run the code, you need to acquire an API token from the dataset website [https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/webservices/v2#gettingStarted). Follow the instruction on this website to create your token and fill it in the second cell after 'api_key = ' to run the code. Then you are free to go.
