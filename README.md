# New-York-City-Central-Park-Weather-Prediction

For our concluding project, we have used the modeling methods to predict future temperatures. We have based our analysis on the GHCND dataset, obtained from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's website. This dataset offers extensive daily weather data, which has been crucial in fine-tuning and adjusting our models to improve their forecasting precision.
